### Instructions to Run the Code

We had implemented all the functionalities for a twitter like engine in Part 1 which will be paired up with a WebSocket API in this part (Part 2). Some of the functionalities are mentioned below :

1. a JSON based API that represents all messages and their replies (including errors)
2. re-wrote parts of our engine to implement the API interface.
3. Implemented a client to use REST API and take inputs from the command line.

### Implementation
