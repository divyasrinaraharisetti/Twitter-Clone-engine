# Twitter-Clone-engine

We had implemented all the functionalities for a twitter like engine in Part 1 which will be paired up with a WebSocket API in this part (Part 2). Some of the functionalities are mentioned below :

1. a JSON based API that represents all messages and their replies (including errors)
2. re-wrote parts of our engine to implement the API interface.
3. Implemented a client to use REST API and take inputs from the command line.

```bash
Download our code from canvas submission In visual studio Code import the twitter API project. Change the folder to TwitterClient on one terminal which is the client side. Change the folder to TwitterServer on second terminal which is the server side. Run the project using command “dotnet run user” on client side and "dotnet run" on server side. The API will start.
